# MyRegionMonitoring
A simple example of region monitoring using CLLocationManager

Created by OOPer in cooperation with shlab.jp, on 2015/8/6.

Rewrite the coordinate (JS_LAT, JS_LON) in ViewController.swlft.

(Check Info.plist, before you import some code into your app.)

This project is intended to be experimental and private.
